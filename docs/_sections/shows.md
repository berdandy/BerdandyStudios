Berdandy Studios creates a livestreamed tabletop game design talk show, called GMParty. [You can watch GMParty on YouTube](http://youtube.com/gmparty).

GMParty is an online recreation of the social game designer chat that tends to happen at conventions and conferences when you happen to get a few designers in the same space together. We usually start with a topic, and then move into a workshopping segment of the show.
