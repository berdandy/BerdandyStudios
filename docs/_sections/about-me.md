Berdandy Studios makes tabletop games. We specialize in mechanics-light, story-heavy collaborative experiences.

We operate using a Open Pre-order Model. Funds received from pre-orders of our games are used to pay artists and other contributors to our games. In this way, as pre-orders come in, better art and more content replaces and/or supplements the functional placeholders created by Berdandy Studios. Everyone benefits and the product gets better. This is a compelling (and hopefully sustainable) alternative to Patreon and Kickstarter models of game development.

Questions about this model? Ping @andyberdan on twitter. He'll be happy to talk about it (and how it's implementable on itch).
