Berdandy Studios makes tabletop games. We specialize in mechanics-light, story-heavy collaborative experiences.

Berdandy Studios operates using an Iterative Open Pre-order Model. As pre-orders are received, better art and more content
replaces and/or supplements the functional placeholders created by Berdandy Studios. Everyone benefits as the product gets
better.  This is a compelling (and hopefully sustainable) alternative to Crowdfunding Campaign models of game development.
